# prompt-mac-agents
Prompt presence notification, random access MAC strategies agents implementation.

Agents' implmentation in C, for `Bernoulli-Trials (BT)` & `tSlots` MAC[^1] random access strategies, developed in scope of the research of uncontrolled, distributed, no-ack MAC strategy in a slotted channel. Main point of the research was to derive all-nodes communication success probability formulas and compare performance for 2 fundamental approaches of no-ack communication, to provide a background for a time-constrained MAC protocol.

# Agents implmentation
This repository contains a proof-of concept C source code of network agents for both analysed strategies (`BT` & `tSlots`).
